Phoca Documentation is not more a component but template override (since Joomla 4).

This is not an installation package. This package includes files which should be copied to your template folder. These files include template override for "List All Categories in an Article Category Tree" view (articles view - displaying all categories).

In this package, there are two folders:

- copy_to_MEDIA folder - just open this folder and copy its subfolder "com_phocadocumentation" to your Joomla "media" folder

- copy_to_TEMPLATES-YOURTEMPLATE folder - just open this folder and copy its subfolder "html" to your Joomla template folder(e.g. to "templates/cassiopeia" folder)
